<h1 id="label-Baseball+Stats">Baseball Stats</h1>

<h2 id="label-Project+Summary">Project Summary</h2>
<ul><li>
<p>Baseball Stats runs on ruby 1.8.7 (haven’t updated my laptop to newest
version, sorry not tested with 1.9.x)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Didn’t use a database</p>
<ul><li>
<p>I wasn’t sure if I could due to more work than just installing some gems</p>
</li><li>
<p>Also would take a long time to initially set up program since 20000+ rows
must be inserted somehow into a database</p>
</li><li>
<p>Stats fields would also be harder to define easily without doing a bunch of
inner joins</p>
</li><li>
<p>If data was going to constantly have reports run against I would think
harder about going this route and reports would just contain sql query to
get results</p>
</li><li>
<p>Probably could do some other nice things in database (use ActiveRecord, add
indexes for foreign_keys like teamID, yearID, playerID) but didn’t think
much more about it since I was too far down a different road without a
database once I found out I could use one.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p>Thought about having a base Player model and creating an inherited hitter
and pitcher class but since a player can be both pitcher and hitter in one
league thought it would overly complicate things. Ended up settling for
extending Player class with modules when necessary for added pitcher
methods. This pitching module would use a new class for modeling the
pitcher stats called PitcherStatSummary. Same thought goes to adding
fielding stats since most players are both.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Wasn’t sure if the players in the most improved batting average report
had to be over 200 at bats for each season or combined. Did each season
since it was combined 500 for fantasy scoring report.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Wasn’t sure if slugging percentage for Oakland was one value for whole
team or each player, so listed each player over .000 and cumulative at end</p>
</li><li>
<p>Fantasy scoring will work for attributes but currently can’t have points
assigned to formulas like batting average or slugging percentage</p>
</li><li>
<p>Wasn’t sure on how many at bats were required for Triple Crown Winner but
required 200 for the season</p>
</li><li>
<p>Started running out of time so reports aren’t tested like I wanted and
some modules have their tests right in the classes that include them</p>
</li><li>
<p>Wrote all tests using RSPEC and can be run using the command ‘bundle exec
rspec’</p>
</li><li>
<p>The README.doc and the rest of the documentation can be viewed in a nicer
format in a browser. I used YARD commenting format, so install the YARD gem
(gem install yard), then run `yard server` and navigate to <a
href="http://0.0.0.0:8808">0.0.0.0:8808</a>/ in your browser for the docs.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Description">Description</h2>

<p>Small program for reading in players and stats and running reports against
that data. Can also calculate fantasy scoring and has an easy way to
configure fantasy scoring.</p>

<h2 id="label-Installation">Installation</h2>

<p>Before running the BaseballStats program there are some dependencies that
must be installed. In baseball stats directory, run</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='rubyid_bundle identifier id'>bundle</span>
</code></pre>

<p>to install all required gems</p>

<p>NOTE: Baseball stats does not use a database so no non-ruby libraries will
need to be installed</p>

<h2 id="label-Configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>Currently the only thing that can be configured in BaseballStats is the
fantasy scoring. This is contained in the config folder in the
fantasy_scoring.json file. Any stat that is contained in the stats data
file can have a value assigned to it to calculate fantasy scoring.</p>

<p>To add a new scoring definition add a key/value pair where the key is the
stat abbreviation and the value is how many points it is worth for each
stat.</p>

<pre class="ruby">{<span class="ruby-string">&quot;HR&quot;</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-value">4</span>, <span class="ruby-string">&quot;CS&quot;</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-value">-1</span>}
</pre>

<h2 id="label-Usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Once all dependencies have been installed, to begin using BaseballStats
just enter</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='rubyid_ruby identifier id'>ruby</span> <span class='rubyid_application identifier id'>application</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='rubyid_rb identifier id'>rb</span>
</code></pre>

<p>First all the data will be read from the players and stats files.</p>

<p>Once this has completed, the user will be presented with a list of reports
that can be run. Enter the number corresponding to the report to run it or
select the last option to exit or just press enter to exit.</p>

<h2 id="label-With+More+Time">With More Time</h2>
<ul><li>
<p>Format output so it is more readable</p>
</li><li>
<p>Add team model to more easily track stats for a team</p>
</li><li>
<p>Write all tests for reports</p>
</li><li>
<p>Define formulas in a config file, find and replace placeholders with stat
values</p>
</li></ul>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='lbrace token'>{</span>
  <span class='label val'>hitting_formulas:</span> <span class='lbrace token'>{</span>
    <span class='label val'>batting_average:</span> <span class='string val'>&quot;H/AB&quot;</span>
  <span class='rbrace token'>}</span><span class='comma token'>,</span>
  <span class='label val'>pitching_formulas:</span> <span class='lbrace token'>{</span>

  <span class='rbrace token'>}</span>
<span class='rbrace token'>}</span>
</code></pre>
<ul><li>
<p>Have Stats defined with a config file so that hitting, pitching, and
fielding stats don’t need to be hard-coded</p>
</li></ul>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='lbrace token'>{</span>
